Firstly I ordered the medium ,The kurta fit well but the pant was a bit tight and as the pant was not stretchable I had to return cause pants with non stretchy material that too with a tight fit although it provides a slim look but it will surely torn in the long run. I exchanged it with the L size where the pant fits well but the kurta is too loose so I had to alter it which is not an issue. Overall it's a comfortable and stylish outfit match for a casual wear. The color is black due to the lighting setup it looks blue."

I usually wear M of this brand but this set was very body fitting so I exchanged it for size L but still felt the need of little more room for Kurta fit. Also sleeves end somewhere on elbow, not up not down this gave a little weird look including bust area. Kurta fabric is good and palazzos fabric is little itchy, may be after wash you will like it but I didn't. Also length is palazzos was little short for me, I am 5'4\". Even after exchanging it from medium to L, felt the fit of palazzos same. May be it looks good on slim girls but not on me. Very disappointed."

May consider wearing a skirt like slip underneath. Overall a good buy at this price. Doesn't look cheap. The kalamkari print in this dark red yellow color combination stands out very well, to camouflauge and hide even the not so flat tummy. The sleeves and collar neck actentuates the attire further. Definitely not for the very hot summer days. But it has an impressive fit. "

Palazzo is in straight fit(fit on belt and loose towards end).The only low it has is its hip size is 2inch less than what mentioned in sizechart so choose a size up if u r CURVY.

You may buy this product if you really liked the beauty of the dress ****My personal opinion after wearing this outfit three times was that the armpit area of top and thigh portion of palazzo got a grey colored stain from clothes dye*****whic shows the clothe and dye used was of cheap quality. This material wont last in the long run so, if you are someone who invests in clothes aiming for its longetivity then this is not the one for you But i really loved wearing it It was really comfortable though a bit transprent."

Fabric quality s jus average ( since i got it fr sale i din mind) but if u buying it fr more than 1000/- i vud say its not worth it 3 cloth shrinks in jus 1 wash, so betta to buy a size bigger than usual"

But I am not so sure about the 36 size bust they have written on S size. It was definitely not 36 ; you can say it is 34 or so. If you want skin fit kurta and have 34 size bust, go for the small size but if you have slightly bulky tummy, I would say don't take risk . Order the next larger size .. I have somewhat broad shoulders that's why I was a little sceptical but thankfully, there was no issue. I am very happy for chosing this kurta for buying. It's looking like Sky blue but trust me it is sea green , the color in some photos is looking diffrent because of the diffrent mobiles nothing else ;)"

So it looks okay, you can pair it with anything and it looks good.   P.s- If you don\u2019t like loose things to wear don\u2019t buy it or go for one size smaller. Thin or slim girls don\u2019t buy it if you\u2019re not comfortable with loose T-shirts and not sure about it. Good for average body though. "

Value for money - Both Kurta and Palazzo in reasonable price, and overall look comes out good  Cons: 1. The length of Kurta from front and behind is not same. It's a bit shorter from behind 2. The width of Kurta hem from front is also little less than behind.  Didn't return because it doesn't look very weird after you wear it."

I had ordered two roadster jeans (30 size), the other one fit me well but the above product of same size was very small. If the size of the jeans you wear fits you perfect then go for 1 size larger, because the product is not at all stretchable.  I exchanged my order with size 32 and it fit comfortably.

Perfect for crop tops. Color is pure black. Gives a clean, smart n good look when worn. It's a tiny bit lose for me at the zip area n below the knee area but it's quite unnoticeable. Only concern is the buttons used in the jeans. The front part of the button might come out pretty fast as it's not too sturdy. But overall the jeans is pretty good at this price. Just loved it\ud83e\udd70"

Since this is a High waist jeans I should have gone for 30 size but size which I bought (32) has perfect fitting on thighs and I could adjust the waist with belt that's why I didn't went for size 30.

No price tag was attached with it. On returning this product, I face so many problems, as the boy was not able to track the ID and was  saying that this product should not be returned. That's quite unsatisfied. This product is so cheap and beyond my expectations."

As the palazzo bottom has design looks good, but if it would be stitched with some stiff material to support from inside, it would be perfect. The bottom tends to roll over when using.  Dupatta again, super light and soft, full size, but something for the border would be better. Overall the stitching should have been done with some expert thinking. The print is kind of rubber one, and looks a little dull than seen in the picture. Certainly a HIGHLY EDITED product image is used.  Still would say a good to buy for regular use."

Looking classy and cool. Summer wearable fabric, in winter can wear knitted jegging underneath. I am 5'4\" , it was 1 inch below my ankle. I am happy with the purchase in sale approx 700/- price... You can go for one size smaller if you are skinny. That will give you amazing fit.."

It's just material is not up to the mark. And 1 disappointment is the uper part if dress is going left side. It's not in center. I have to adjust this again n again. That's why m giving 4 star.

You can wear it as a dress or as a kurta anything will suit. The mask is just a matching piece of cloth so it's useless in terms of protection. You can wear it for fashion it looks beautiful. Got is for 700 during sale. Totally a deal!"

Thanks for the prompt delivery Myntra. Definitely recommend buying this dress."

The gher is huge and looks so pretty especially with the colour.  Definitely will have to maintain it due to the khadi work.  I loved the dress. Can wear it as and when u like. Maybe with heavy accessories you can wear it for festives too. If not, then daily wear to your office is perfect.   PS. The mask is of same cloth as the dress and therefore it's pretty useless as a protective mask, for fashion it's good. For protection against virus it's a big no.   The 5 stars is the dress only.  Definitely a thumbs up. "

The only shortcoming is that it felt oddly tight in the waist area. For high waisted trousers, I usually go for 26 or 28 size. In this one, 28 is somewhat tight even on the narrowest part of my waist. But I chose to keep it as I like it otherwise and a size bigger would make me look like a potato sac. :p"

Button will not survive more than five washing machine cycles. And if they break, the entire trouser wilk be wasted because the cloth is not strong enough to survive repair.    The fabric and color is decent. Trouser is too baggy at the thighs but that can managed. For INR 800+ the product should have better hardware so that buyers can use the clothes beyond 30 washes at least."

I\u2019m 5\u20198 and it easily touches my ankles so length is adequate although slightly roomy as I ordered 02 sizes up to be safe as most Indian brands don\u2019t have a standard sizing chart. Took one star off the review as came with one button missing..vendors need to do a quality check before shipping out orders.Otherwise looks good for a casual day or eve out.

Just keep in mind if you\u2019re on the shorter height around 4ft or 5ft, 5.5ft side then it will definitely be way longer for you. I suggest you do your measurements before you jump in and purchase.

I really like long kurta bcoz they look more elegant. Dupatta is fab.  And trousers' fabric is too thin,  if ur kurta gets blown with wind underwear's color can be seen. Size of kurta is accurate as per chart.  Over all this is a bit expensive as compared to the quality,  but again Inddus clothes are always highly priced,  they give poor cloth quality but they choose best rare colors like this one and the other color sea green one in same style.  So even though i hav big problems with kurta length being short,  i m keeping it bcoz of its unique color,  dupatta and fit. "

Material is slightly firm but flowing when worn.SHRUNK QUIET a  few inches after first wash thankfully doesn't bleed and I purchased a larger size so fits me.Not very transparent but if conscious you can wear an inner but then definitely sizing up when buying.Overall an okay value as got it on Sale."

You can style it both ways as formal and informal , I just wish they provided a waist belt with it so that it could have been tighter at belly plus that would\u2019ve added a statement to the look too . But as per what I paid , I got an incredible product and I loved it . I\u2019m a bust 36 and I bought M first which was extremely loose to me from bust and overall wide too then I went for S and it turned out loose too , I bought XS and now I\u2019m really satisfied with the fit ! I feel like the sizes should\u2019ve been more clearly described , but myntra\u2019s brilliant service made it an easy exchange in a short span of time !! "

Just like our markers. Yes. Those bright florescent markers. Exactly that. This set looks amazing when worn. So full marks for that. Besides, the kurta and sharara can be used individually as well for mix and match. I tried the kurta with blue pants and it looked pleasantly amazing on it's own too. There is a lot of room to play around with that. I could say, if you are considering buying this or not, take it. It's worth a try. :) "
